# Source-of-truth template for the homebrew tap formula (0626, feat/local-launcher).
# .github/workflows/release.yml renders this on every v* tag — swapping https://github.com/manwray/homebrew-tickle/releases/download/v0.6.15/tickle-0.6.15-darwin-universal.tar.gz,
# 4b8627981f248576a6801c097491725e57ecdc5c7bb338d552d2bb2321aa9a82, 0.6.15 for the just-published darwin universal tarball — and pushes
# the result to manwray/homebrew-tickle as Formula/tickle.rb (bump-on-release; no
# hand-editing). The committed Formula/tickle.rb in this repo is a rendered example
# of this template; brew always reads the tap copy.
